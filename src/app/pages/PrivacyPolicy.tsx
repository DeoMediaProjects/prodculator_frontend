Individual scripts are NEVER identifiable in these reports.</li>
          </ul>

          <Typography sx={{ fontWeight: 700, color: '#D4AF37', mt: 3, mb: 1 }}>

          <Typography variant="h4">4. Data Storage & Security</Typography>
          <Typography>
            <strong>4.1 Encryption:</strong> All data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            <strong>4.2 Access Controls:</strong> Strict role-based access controls limit who can view your data internally.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            <strong>4.3 Script Confidentiality:</strong> Uploaded scripts are treated as confidential trade secrets and are never shared with third parties or used for training AI models.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            <strong>4.4 API Security:</strong> API keys are hashed and encrypted. Enterprise clients receive unique keys with rate limiting and IP whitelisting (optional).
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            <strong>4.5 Data Retention:</strong>

          </ul>
          <Typography>
            <strong>4.6 Production Intelligence Dashboard - Anonymized Metadata:</strong> When you upload a script, we automatically extract anonymized metadata (estimated crew size, camera equipment requirements, cast size indicators, production scale) to power our Production Intelligence Dashboard. This dashboard shows aggregate industry trends (e.g., "Average crew size for action films: 85 people") and is shared with enterprise clients. Your specific script content, project title, character names, dialogue, and plot details are NEVER included in this analysis. Only non-identifiable production logistics metadata is extracted and aggregated across hundreds of scripts.
