          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            <strong>3.2 Not Real-Time:</strong> Data is NOT real-time and should not be relied upon as the sole basis for financial, legal, or production decisions. Users must independently verify all data with official government sources, legal counsel, tax advisors, and industry professionals.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            <strong>3.3 No Guarantee:</strong> We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any data. Tax incentive rates, crew costs, and location availability are subject to change without notice by external authorities.

            <strong>3.4 User Responsibility:</strong> Users are solely responsible for verifying all information before making production, financial, or legal commitments.

          <Typography variant="h4">6. Intellectual Property</Typography>
          <Typography>
            <strong>6.1 Platform Ownership:</strong> The Platform, including all software, algorithms, designs, trademarks, and content (excluding user-uploaded scripts), is the exclusive property of Prodculator and protected by copyright, trademark, and intellectual property laws.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            <strong>6.2 User Scripts:</strong> You retain all rights to scripts you upload. By uploading, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to process your script solely for the purpose of generating intelligence reports.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            <strong>6.3 Anonymized Metadata for Production Intelligence:</strong> When you upload a script, we automatically extract anonymized metadata (crew size estimates, equipment requirements, cast scale indicators, production complexity) to power our Production Intelligence Dashboard. This data is aggregated with data from other users to show industry trends (e.g., "Average crew size for action productions: 85 people"). Your script's specific content, title, character names, dialogue, and plot are NEVER used or shared. Only non-identifiable production logistics metadata is extracted. This aggregated data may be shared with enterprise clients (film commissions, studios, equipment rental companies) as part of market intelligence reports.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            <strong>6.4 Generated Reports:</strong> Intelligence reports generated by the Platform are licensed to you for internal use only. You may share reports with collaborators, investors, and production teams but may not resell, redistribute, or publish reports commercially without written permission.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            <strong>6.5 Enterprise Deliverables:</strong> Reports, data, and analyses delivered to enterprise clients under B2B contracts are licensed for internal organizational use as specified in individual agreements.
