            <div>
              <p>Most tools give you a rebate percentage and leave you to do the rest. Prodculator thinks for the producer.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Scripteligence, not just a calculator</strong> — We read your actual screenplay to understand what your production physically requires, not just what you tell a form. A script with 78% interior scenes has very different location logic than one shot mostly outdoors.</li>
                <li><strong>Four-layer financial analysis</strong> — Every territory is assessed on incentive return, currency purchasing power, crew cost differential, and infrastructure — combined into one total saving figure. The incentive is often not the biggest number.</li>
                <li><strong>The full picture, for investors</strong> — Our Investor Summary panel separates "safe for investor documents" figures from figures that require verification. This is a real distinction that matters in production finance.</li>
                <li><strong>15 territories, deeply analysed</strong> — Not 5 countries with surface-level data. Every territory includes programme reliability scoring, payment timeline, minimum spend thresholds, and investor safety flags.</li>
                <li><strong>Production viability intelligence</strong> — If you have exterior scenes and a filming date, we cross-reference your schedule against historical climate data for each territory and flag any conflicts. We think about what your shoot will actually encounter.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy First</strong> — Your script is deleted immediately after analysis. You retain 100% IP ownership. We never train on your content.</li>

                Prodculator is operated by <strong>Deo Media Limited</strong> (Company Number: 15426752), a UK-registered company specialising in film production intelligence and data services.
              </p>
              <p>
                The platform was built by people who have worked in and around film production and understand the gap between what producers need at script stage and what existing tools actually provide. Prodculator was created to close that gap.

                Your script is used solely to extract production metadata — scene counts, locations, cast requirements, period and setting, and special production signals. The moment that extraction is complete, your original file is permanently deleted from our servers.
              </p>
              <p>
                We store only the extracted metadata (scene counts, INT/EXT ratio, production signals) needed to generate your report. We never store, archive, read, or share your screenplay text. You retain 100% IP ownership of your work at all times.

                <strong>No.</strong> Uploading your script to Prodculator does not grant us any rights to your screenplay, story, characters, or any creative content. We extract production metadata and immediately discard the source file. See our Terms of Service for the full IP clause.

                <strong>No.</strong> Your script is never used for AI training purposes. It is processed in a single, isolated analysis pass and then deleted. We use the Anthropic Claude API for script analysis — see Anthropic's data processing terms at anthropic.com for details of how API inputs are handled.

                We accept <strong>PDF, DOCX, and TXT</strong> formats up to 10MB. Standard screenplay formatting (Final Draft exports, industry PDFs) works best. Unformatted treatments or outlines will produce lower-quality analysis — the tool is designed for scripts with scene headings (INT./EXT.).

              <p>
                Partial scripts will still generate a report, but the analysis will reflect only the scenes provided. If you have 60 pages of a 120-page feature, our scene counts and INT/EXT ratios will be based on what's there. We recommend uploading the most complete draft available for accurate results. You can re-run analysis on an updated draft — each submission counts as one of your monthly script allowances.

            <div>
              <p>
                The <strong>Investor Summary panel</strong> is a structured financial overview that appears at the top of your report. It shows your top 3 recommended territories side by side with a clear breakdown of the financial advantage each offers — and, critically, flags which figures are "safe for investor documents" and which require independent verification before being presented to investors or gap financiers.
              </p>
              <p>
                This matters because some territory incentive programmes are reliable and can legitimately be included in production finance projections. Others have had payment delays or programme changes and should not be presented as guaranteed income to investors without verification. We make this distinction clear so you know exactly what you're working with.

          answer: (
            <div>
              <p>
                This is the core of what Prodculator does. For every territory, we calculate four separate financial layers and combine them into a total figure:
              </p>
              <div>
                <p><strong>Layer 1 — Tax Incentive:</strong> The rebate or credit available from the territory's government programme, applied to your qualifying spend. Rate, minimum spend, payment timeline, and reliability score are all shown.</p>
                <p><strong>Layer 2 — Currency Purchasing Power:</strong> If your budget is in GBP and you're shooting somewhere with a weaker currency, your money buys more locally. We calculate what your GBP budget is actually worth in local purchasing power for all local costs — crew, locations, catering, transport, accommodation, extras. This is shown as a concrete GBP-equivalent saving, not just an exchange rate.</p>
                <p><strong>Layer 3 — Crew Cost Differential:</strong> We compare UK BECTU minimum rates against published local crew rate guides for each territory. For the number of crew and shoot days you've specified, we calculate the saving from paying local rates instead of UK rates.</p>
                <p><strong>Layer 4 — Infrastructure & Logistics:</strong> Practical notes on studio facilities, visa requirements, seasonal viability, and any production-specific flags raised by your script or camera equipment choices.</p>
              </div>
              <p>
                The <strong>Total Saving</strong> figure you see is the sum of Layers 1–3, with Layer 4 as contextual information. This is why South Africa can show a larger total saving than Malta even though Malta's incentive rate is higher — because South Africa's currency and crew advantages can exceed the incentive difference for many productions.
              </p>
            </div>
          ),
        },
        {
          question: 'What is the Production Viability Advisory?',
          answer: (
            <div>
              <p>
                If your script has more than 30% exterior scenes and you've provided a filming start date and duration, we cross-reference your schedule against historical climate data for each territory using the Open-Meteo API.
              </p>
              <p>
                The result appears on each territory card as a colour-coded advisory:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Green</strong> — Good filming window: Your exterior scenes fall within this territory's optimal season</li>
                <li><strong>Amber</strong> — Weather consideration: A scheduling factor to be aware of — short daylight hours, rainy season risk, or temperature extremes that affect outdoor filming</li>
                <li><strong>Red</strong> — Scheduling conflict flagged: Your planned dates coincide with conditions that may make this territory impractical for the exterior volume in your script</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Importantly, a red advisory does not remove or hide the territory's financial figures. If the financial case for a territory is strong, that remains visible alongside the scheduling flag. The advisory helps you make an informed decision — it doesn't make the decision for you.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your production is predominantly interior (studio-flexible), this advisory does not appear — it isn't relevant.

          question: 'What are "comparable productions"?',
          answer: (
            <div>
              <p>
                The <strong>Comparables</strong> section shows real films and series that share characteristics with your project — similar genre, budget range, and interior/exterior profile — and records where they were produced, which incentive programme they used, and what that territory delivered.
              </p>
              <p>
                This serves two purposes: it gives you production precedent (if a film with a similar profile to yours shot in Malta and used the 40% rebate successfully, that's meaningful context), and it helps investors and financiers see that the territory and incentive combination you're proposing has been used in practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                Comparable productions are sourced from IMDb Pro and The Movie Database (TMDb) and matched algorithmically to your script's profile.

          question: 'What is a "reliability score" and why does it matter?',
          answer: (
            <div>
              <p>
                Every territory incentive programme in our database carries a <strong>reliability score from 0 to 1.0</strong>. This reflects how consistently and predictably the programme pays out, based on published payment records, industry reports, and producer feedback.
              </p>
              <p>
                A score of 1.0 means the programme is fully reliable — payments are made on the stated schedule and the programme is well established. A score below 0.5 means there have been significant issues — funding delays, programme changes, or uncertainty that makes us flag the territory for verification before investor use.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>South Africa</strong> is the most important example. Its DTI/NFVF programme has experienced funding delays in 2023–2025, giving it a reliability score below 0.5. Our report flags this clearly — the incentive figure is shown with a caution indicator and is not marked as safe for investor documents. However — and this is critical — South Africa's currency and crew advantages are completely separate from the incentive programme and are shown normally. A producer can still benefit enormously from shooting in South Africa on the strength of those two layers alone, without relying on the incentive.
              </p>

          question: 'What does "safe for investor documents" mean?',
          answer: (
            <div>
              <p>
                The Investor Summary panel marks each territory's figures as <strong>"Safe for investor documents," "Verify before including in investor projections," or "Status unconfirmed."</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                This distinction exists because production finance is a specific context. Including projected incentive income in a production finance plan presented to investors has legal and reputational implications if the programme fails to pay. Some programmes — Malta's cash rebate, the UK's IFTC, Ireland's Section 481 — are well-established, pay reliably, and can reasonably be included in investor-facing financial projections. Others require independent verification before doing so.
              </p>
              <p>
                We make this call using our reliability score, publicly available information about programme status, and industry knowledge. It is an assessment, not legal advice — always verify with a qualified entertainment accountant before presenting incentive projections to investors.

          answer: (
            <div>
              <p>
                <strong>Yes, for the UK specifically.</strong> Our UK territory analysis includes the base AVEC/IFTC calculation plus regional stacking opportunities:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Screen Scotland</strong> — additional funding for productions shooting in Scotland</li>
                <li><strong>Creative Wales</strong> — additional funding for productions shooting in Wales</li>
                <li><strong>Northern Ireland Screen</strong> — recoupable loan scheme for productions shooting in Northern Ireland</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Regional stacking can add materially to the UK financial case. For a production that genuinely fits a regional profile, the combined figure can be more competitive than it first appears.
              </p>
              <p>
                For other territories, we note regional variations where they are significant (e.g. Spain's Canary Islands rate of 30–45% vs mainland 20–25%).

              <p>
                Our figures are <strong>indicative estimates</strong> based on publicly available programme information, reviewed quarterly. They are starting points for planning, not guarantees.
              </p>
              <p>
                Incentive programmes change. Rates, qualifying spend definitions, minimum thresholds, and payment timelines are all subject to revision by the relevant government or agency. Our data includes a last-verified date for each territory record so you can see how current our information is.
              </p>
              <p>
                You must verify all figures with the relevant film commission and a qualified entertainment accountant before making financial commitments, entering into production finance arrangements, or presenting figures to investors.

              </p>
              <p>
                The free report gives you: key findings and top 3 territory recommendations with headline saving figures, a full territory ranking showing where all 15 territories sit in order, and a preview of the Scripteligence analysis of your script.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sections 3–8 (budget scenarios, detailed territory breakdowns, funding sources, festival recommendations) are locked on the free plan. You'll see what they contain and can unlock them by upgrading to Professional.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is intentional. Most producers work on one script for months. A monthly free plan would be abused — we'd rather give you something genuinely useful once than something limited every month.

              </p>
              <p>
                At <strong>£750/month</strong>, it delivers anonymised market intelligence derived from production activity on the Prodculator platform: which territories are being selected by producers, what budget ranges are in the pipeline, what genres and formats are coming to market, crew size distribution, and camera equipment demand signals.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is not a script analysis product. It answers a different question: "What productions are heading to my territory or using my services?" It is not visible on the main pricing page and is accessed via the B2B route or by contacting us directly.

                Every financial figure in a Prodculator report — incentive amounts, currency savings, crew cost differentials — is an estimate based on our datasets at the time of calculation. It is <strong>indicative:</strong> directionally accurate and useful for planning, but not a quote, not a guarantee, and not a figure you can contractually rely upon.
              </p>
              <p>
                Incentive programme rates change. Exchange rates move daily. Crew costs vary by role, experience level, and negotiation. We give you the best estimate we can from the data we have — but the actual numbers for your specific production will be determined by qualified professionals working with current, verified information.

                <li>Commission a qualified entertainment accountant to verify the incentive figures for your shortlisted territories</li>
